### Dashboard

View a breakdown of your study sessions. There are plans to include more graphs that further breakdown your study sessions (including breakdown of location, distractions, deep work, etc).



Currently there is a treemap to see a breakdown of the topics you've studied and a heatmap with the days you've studied and how long.
